# ServerlessRandomBot
~~Created in less than 40 minutes to choose who would get the best bed in AirBnb~~

It's [coinbot](https://github.com/timolins/coinbot), but serverless and not dead

## Feature list
+ `/coin` - Flips a coin
+ `/dice` - Rolls a dice from 1 to 6
+ `/dice X` - Rolls a dice from 1 to X
+ `/list` - Chooses an option from a list

I might add inline queries later
